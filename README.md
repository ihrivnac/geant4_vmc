Geant4 VMC 
===========

Geant4 VMC implements the Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) for Geant4, see more: <br/>
[https://root.cern.ch/vmc](https://root.cern.ch/vmc)

It also includes G4Root and MTRoot packages, which are independent from Geant4 VMC and can be build and used stand-alone.

## Installation

  Geant4 VMC requires ROOT and Geant4 installed, and optionally, it can be
  built with [http://ivana.home.cern.ch/ivana/VGM.html](VGM).
  
  Since version 3.00, Geant4 VMC is installed with CMake. To install
  geant4_vmc:

  1. First get the Geant4 VMC source from the Download page. We will assume
     that the Geant4 VMC package sits in a subdirectory
     /mypath/geant4_vmc

  2. Create build directory alongside our source directory
```bash
     $ cd /mypath
     $ mkdir geant4_vmc_build
     $ ls
     geant4_vmc geant4_vmc_build
```

  3. To configure the build, change into the build directory and run CMake:
```bash
     $ cd /mypath/geant4_vmc_build
     $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/geant4_vmc_install /mypath/geant4_vmc
```

     If ROOT and Geant4 environment was defined using thisroot.[c]sh and
     geant4.[c]sh scripts, there is no need to provide path to their installations.
     Otherwise, they can be provided using -DROOT_DIR and -DGeant4_DIR cmake
     options.

  4. After the configuration has run, CMake will have generated Unix Makefiles
     for building Geant4 VMC. To run the build, simply execute make in the build
     directory:
```bash
     $ make -jN
```

     where N is the number of parallel jobs you require (e.g. if your machine has a dual
     core processor, you could set N to 2).
     If you need more output to help resolve issues or simply for information, run make as
```bash
     $ make -jN VERBOSE=1
```

     Once the build has completed, you can install Geant4 VMC to the directory you specified
     earlier in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX by running
     $ make install

     This will build geant4_vmc, g4root and mtroot packages. For VMC examples see VMC
     examples installation page.

## Build Options

  Geant4 VMC includes G4Root and MTRoot packages, which are independent from Geant4 VMC
  and can be build and used stand-alone. Use of G4Root, VGM, Geant4 G3toG4, UI and VIS
  packages in Geant4 VMC library is optional and can be switched on/off during CMake build.

  Overview of available options and their default values:

      Geant4VMC_BUILD_G4Root       Build G4Root        ON
      Geant4VMC_BUILD_MTRoot       Build MTRoot        ON
      Geant4VMC_BUILD_Geant4VMC    Build Geant4VMC     ON
      Geant4VMC_BUILD_EXAMPLES     Build VMC examples  ON
  
      Geant4VMC_USE_G4Root         Build with G4Root                ON
      Geant4VMC_USE_VGM            Build with VGM                   OFF
      Geant4VMC_USE_GEANT4_UI      Build with Geant4 UI drivers     ON
      Geant4VMC_USE_GEANT4_VIS     Build with Geant4 Vis drivers    ON
      Geant4VMC_USE_GEANT4_G3TOG4  Build with Geant4 G3toG4 library OFF
  
      Geant4VMC_INSTALL_EXAMPLES   Install examples    ON


## Required and optional packages:

  Geant4 VMC requires the Root and Geant4 installations,
  and optionally VGM in case you want to run with Geant4
  native navigation with geometry defined via Root TGeo.
  
  The path to required and optional packages installations can be defined in these
  complementary ways:

  a) Via path to the CMake configuration file

        ROOT_DIR              ... path to ROOTConfig.cmake
        Geant4_DIR            ... path to Geant4Config.cmake
        VGM_DIR               ... path to VGMConfig.cmake

  b) Using their configuration script which is available
     in your PATH (Geant4 and Root):

        geant4-config         ... Geant4 configuration script
        root-config           ... Root configuration script

     To make these configuration scripts available in your PATH,
     you should source the relevant script from the packages
     installation:

        bin/geant4.[c]sh      ... Geant4
        bin/thisroot.[c]sh    ... Root

  c) With the environment variable ROOTSYS (Root only)

        ROOTSYS         ... path to Root

  The compilation with VGM (optional) can be selected via the CMake option:

        -DGeant4VMC_USE_VGM=ON
  

## Examples
  
Since Geant4 VMC 3.00, VMC examples are installed with CMake.
The VMC examples libraries require ROOT installation, the VMC examples programs are built
against Geant3 with VMC or Geant4 VMC libraries.

More details about provided configuration macros and tests
can be found in examples/README.

The instructions how to build and run examples are provided
in examples/README_INSTALL.

##  Root and Geant4 UI

#### Switching UI

When running Geant4 with Virtual MC a user can switch between
Root UI and Geant4 UI:

From Root to Geant4 UI:

      root [0] ((TGeant4*)gMC)->StartGeantUI();

From Geant4 to Root UI:

      PreInit> /mcControl/root

#### Calling macros

Call Geant4 macro "myMacro.in" from Root:

      root [0] ((TGeant4*)gMC)->ProcessGeantMacro("myMacro.in");

Call Root macro "myMacro.C" from Geant4:

      PreInit> /mcControl/rootMacro myMacro


#### Calling commands

Call Geant4 command from Root:

      root [0] ((TGeant4*)gMC)->ProcessGeantCommand("/tracking/verbose 1");

Call Root command from Geant4:

      Idle> /mcControl/rootCmd TBrowser b;
